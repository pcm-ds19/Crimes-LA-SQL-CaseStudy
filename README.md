# Crimes-LA-SQL-CaseStudy
SQL Case Study – Analyzing Los Angeles crime data using SQL queries | PGP-DSBA (Great Lakes &amp; Texas McCombs) 

##  Project Overview  
The mayor of Los Angeles established a new Criminal Investigation Division to analyze rising crime trends.  
As part of the Analytics Division, I performed **SQL-based analysis** to answer critical business questions and uncover patterns in crime data.  

This case study demonstrates SQL skills in querying, filtering, joining, and aggregating data to provide actionable insights for city authorities.

##  Objectives  
- Identify major crime categories and frequency  
- Analyze year-wise and month-wise crime trends  
- Find areas with the highest crime density  
- Study victim demographics and age-group analysis  
- Generate reports for policymakers to improve safety measures

##  Skills & Tools Used  
- **SQL**: Filtering, Aggregation, Window Functions, Subqueries, CASE WHEN  
- **Joins**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN  
- **Advanced SQL**: Mathematical calculations, Derived columns  
- **Visualization**: Generated outputs to answer analytical questions

##  Key Insights  
- Theft and Assault were among the **most frequent crimes** in LA.  
- Certain regions consistently reported **higher crime density**.  
- Analysis revealed that young adults were the most common victims.  
- Seasonal/monthly patterns indicated spikes during specific times.

##  Repository Structure  
- `Crimes_LA.sql` → SQL queries used for the analysis  
- `Crimes_LA_Report.pdf` → Business report with findings and insights  

---

##  Learnings  
- Improved SQL query writing with complex filters and joins  
- Gained ability to transform raw data into actionable insights  
- Enhanced report writing skills for communicating results
